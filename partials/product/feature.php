	<h1>Iro new generation</h1>
	<p>IRO is a smartband with a unique design, assuming its inspirations marked by the world of video games and Japanese animation. IRO is dedicated to monitoring the physical activity of a person and is targeting a crowd of tech lovers and geeks.
	The bracelet works with a free application containing the codes of the world of gaming with an experience system, grades and badges. We based the concept on a playful color coded and seven easy-to-use colors for seven levels of activity. 
	The calculation range for the levels is on a seven-day basis, moving in time continuously. IRO allows you to easily compare and compete between users and also participate in unique events, like competing with the ambassadors of the brand. With its specific interface, IRO encourages its user to maintain a level of physical activity in a fun and trendy way. 
	Based on their experience and grades, IRO owners will have bonuses and benefits in a series of video games..</p>

	<h1>Challenge & Hero challenge</h1>
	<p>You can start an IRO challenge with your friends! As in the world of gaming, there are currently three modes of challenges: 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2 and an arena of 4 players.
	The goal is to have the best trend over a standard period of seven days. You can create challenges and invite up to three friends to participate. These challenges make the users gain experience and allow them to obtain higher grades. 
	Finally, we created a completely new mode exclusive to IRO; you will be able to challenge the brand ambassadors. The Hero Challenge will be available for ephemeral events during specific periods. The places available for participation will be limited, and the goal will be to beat the hero!</p>

	<h1>Profil & Goal</h1>
	<p>Once the IRO profile is created, the user can monitor their progress and objectives via profile page. They can then modify personal data if they want to, including age, height, weight and gender, as well as check his grade, current IRO level, number of badges acquired and number of friends. 
	The spiral on the bracelet changes color depending on the level of calories burned over a period of seven days moving on time. The goal for any IRO user is to reach the green level and try to keep it. Once reached, the user has the ability to change their target upward if desired.</p>

	<h1>Grades, Badges & Lifestyle</h1>
	<p>The IRO application integrates a system of grades and experience as well as badges.
	Grades ranging from 1 to 50 will reflect the experience level of the IRO user. These grades will provide access to additional bonuses in the partner games and coupons for our IRONOVA shop.
	We have implemented an action list in the application to gain experience and fifty badges to unlock. Finally, in order for no one to be disadvantaged in the point of view of physical activity, the application also manages three user profiles, or lifestyles.
	Each lifestyle has a bonus system and experience gain, which balances the progress of each.

	<h1>Iro is different</h1>
	<p>IRO is not a simple smartband. IRONOVA has a partnership with Honikou Games (more than five million downloads), and its new game, Fight Kub, is a free-to-play mobile fighting game for up to four players online.
	Owning one IRO allows you to win virtual currency daily as well as chests and bonuses based on the actual level of physical activity, its IRO color and grade! This concept is completely new and unique in the world of wearables!
